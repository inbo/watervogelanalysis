# Statistical analysis

## Selection of the raw data

In order to get stable models, we have to restrict the data to only those sites and periods which are relevant for the species.
Keeping so-called structural zero's would flatten the trend.
A site is considered relevant for a species when a species is observed during at least three different winters and during at least four combinations of winter and month.
Some species might emerge or disappear during the time frame of the monitoring.
In such case we will remove every winter prior to the emergence and after the disappearance from the dataset.
Because we will impute missing observation, we require that the observers collected data during at least ten different years at a site.
Otherwise the final results will be highly dominated by sparsely visited sites.

The Flemish dataset contains data for the six winter months (October through March), whereas the Walloon data is limits to four winter months (November through February).
The results at the Belgian level will be therefore restricted to the four winter months.
Some species migrate only during a shorter part of the winter to Belgium.
We further limit the data to those months where the average counts are at least 5% of the month with the largest average counts.

## Imputing missing observations

The final analysis is on the trend of the total wintering population.
A simple summation of all observed birds underestimates this total population when some of the data is missing.
To solve this problem, we have to impute the missing counts.
First we fit a model to the available observations.
This model allows us to predict the number of birds at given site, winter and month.
Then we use this model to generate plausible values for the missing observations.
The augmented data (observations + imputed values) has counts for every combination of site, winter and month.
We aggregate this augmented data into a montly population total $T_{wm}$ by summation of the counts of every site $s$ for each combination of winter $w$ and month $m$.
All further analyses use these monthly population totals.

$$T_{ws} = \sum^S_{s = 1}Y_{swm}$$

### Imputation model

The model estimates the number of birds $Y_{swm}$ at site $s$, winter $w$ and month $m$.
We assume that the number of birds follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $\mu_{swm}$ and overdispersion parameter $n$.

$$Y_{swm} \sim NB(\mu_{swm}, n)$$

The mean $\mu_{swm}$ is the link to the linear predictor by 

$$\log(\mu_{swm}) = \eta_{swm}$$

The linear predictor $\eta_{swm}$ depends on six terms:

1. $\beta_0$ is the global average at the reference month.
1. $\beta_m$ is the global effect of a given month relative to the reference month.
There are $m - 1$ parameters, since one month is used as the reference.
1. $b_s$ is the relative effect of site $s$.
It follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with variance $\sigma^2_{s}$.
1. $b_w$ is the relative effect of winter $w$. 
We use a first order random walk in order to take into account the temporal autocorrelation.
The difference between two consecutive year follows a zero mean Gaussian distribtuion with variance $\sigma^2_w$.
1. $b_{wm}$ is the relative effect of the combination of winter $w$ and month $m$. 
This effect models deviations from the global seasonal pattern in a given year $w$.
It follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with variance $\sigma^2_{wm}$.
1. $b_{sw}$ is the relative effect of the combination of site $s$ and winter $w$. 
The effect captures a deviating trend at site $s$.
It follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with variance $\sigma^2_{sw}$.

$$\eta_{swm} = \beta_0 + \beta_m + b_s + b_w + b_{wm} + b_{sw}$$

$$b_{s} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{s})$$

$$b_w - b_{w - 1} = \Delta_{b_w} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_w)$$

$$b_{wm} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{wm})$$

$$b_{sw} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{sw})$$

We fit the model in R using INLA.
As INLA using a Bayesian approach, we need to specify priors for the (hyper-)parameters.

- $\beta_0$ and $\beta_m$ get a Gaussian prior $\mathcal{N}(0, 1000)$.
- $\sigma^2_s$ gets a penalised complexity prior so that $Prob(\sigma_s > 1) = 0.001$.
- $\sigma^2_w$ gets a penalised complexity prior so that $Prob(\sigma_w > 0.1) = 0.01$.
- $\sigma^2_{sw}$ gets a penalised complexity prior so that $Prob(\sigma_{sw} > 0.25) = 0.01$.
- $\sigma^2_{wm}$ gets a penalised complexity prior so that $Prob(\sigma_{wm} > 0.25) = 0.01$.
- $n$ gets a penalised complexity prior so that $n \sim \Gamma(1/7, 1/7)$.

### Multiple imputation

We use the imputation model to generate plausible values for the missing observations.
Althought the predictions of the imputation model are the most plausible values, we cannot use them as this would reduce the variability in the data.
Then more missing values, would lead to less variability and thus smaller credible intervals compared to a complete data set.
This is ofcourse non sense.

Instead we impute the missing data with a random value based on the prediction distribution of the imputation model.
This takes both the natural variability and the model uncertainty into account.
Then the variability is the data will be larger than the variability in the observed data.
The increase of the variability depends on a) the number of missing observations and b) the model uncertainty of the imputation model.
More missing data or a poorer model fit (more uncertainty) will lead to more variability and thus wider credible intervals.

With the missing values replaced by imputation set $l$, the dataset is complete. 
So we can apply the analysis that we wanted to do in the first place.
The analysis results in a set of coefficients ${\gamma_a}_l$ and their standard error ${\sigma_a}_l$. 
Of course, this set will depend on the imputed values of the imputation set $l$. 
Another imputation set has different imputed values and will hence lead to different coefficients.

Therefore the imputation, aggregation and analysis is repeated for $L = 100$ different imputation sets, resulting in $L$ sets of coefficients and their standard errors. 
They are aggregated by the formulas below. 
The coefficient will be the average of the coefficient in all imputation sets. 
The standard error of a coefficient is the square root of a sum of two parts. 
The first part is the average of the squared standard error in all imputation sets.
The second part is the variance of the coefficient among the imputation sets, multiplied by a correction factor $1 + \frac{1}{L}$. 

$$\bar{\gamma}_a = \frac{\sum_{l = 1}^L{\gamma_a}_l}{L}$$
$$\bar{\sigma}_a = \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{l = 1}^J {{\sigma_a^2}_l}}{L} + (1 + \frac{1}{L}) 
\frac{\sum_{l = 1}^L({\gamma_a}_l - \bar{\gamma}_a) ^ 2}{L - 1}}$$

## Analyses on monthly population totals

### Non-linear seasonal population average

The model estimates the monthly population total of birds $T_{wm}$ at winter $w$ and month $m$.
We assume that the montly population total  follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $\mu_{wm}$ and overdispersion parameter $n$.

$$T_{wm} \sim NB(\mu_{wm}, n)$$
The mean $\mu_{wm}$ is the link to the linear predictor by 

$$\log(\mu_{wm}) = \eta_{wm}$$

The linear predictor $\eta_{swm}$ depends on three terms:

1. $\beta_0$ is the global average at the reference winter.
We use the last winter in the data as reference.
1. $b_w$ is the relative effect of winter $w$. 
We use a first order random walk in order to take into account the temporal autocorrelation.
The difference between two consecutive year follows a zero mean Gaussian distribtuion with variance $\sigma^2_w$.
1. $b_{m}$ is the relative effect of month $m$. 
This effect models the global seasonal pattern $w$.
It follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with variance $\sigma^2_{m}$.

$$\eta_{swm} = \beta_0 + b_w + b_m$$

$$b_w - b_{w - 1} = \Delta_{b_w} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_w)$$

$$b_{m} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{m})$$

The seasonal population average in winter $w$ ($S_w$) is the combination of the global intercept ($\beta_0$) and the effect of winter $w$ ($b_w$).
This is conceptually similar to the geometric mean of the monthly population totals $T_{wm}$, corrected for the global seasonal pattern.
When the seasonal pattern is stable over the time series, the credible interval on the seasonal population will be more narrow than that of the geometric mean.
This analysis is always run on the entire time series.

$$S_w = e^{\beta_0 + b_w}$$

The index $I_{ir}$ for winter $i$ using winter $r$ as reference is the seasonal population average for winter $i$ ($S_i$) divided by the seasonal population average for winter $r$ ($S_r$).

$$I_{ir} = \frac{S_i}{S_r}$$
We can substute $S_w$ with the formula we gave above, resulting in

$$I_{ir} = \frac{e^{\beta_0 + b_{w_i}}}{e^{\beta_0 + b_{w_r}}}$$

which we can simplify to

$$I_{ir} = \frac{e ^{b_{w_i}}}{e^{b_{w_r}}}  = e ^{b_{w_i} - b_{w_r}}$$

Note that the index only depends on the difference in winter effects.
The index at reference winter is by default exact $e^0 = 1$ and pointless to calculate or display.

### Linear trend in seasonal population average

The model estimates the monthly population total of birds $T_{wm}$ at winter $w$ and month $m$.
We assume that the montly population total  follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $\mu_{wm}$ and overdispersion parameter $n$.

$$T_{wm} \sim NB(\mu_{wm}, n)$$
The mean $\mu_{wm}$ is the link to the linear predictor by 

$$\log(\mu_{wm}) = \eta_{wm}$$

The linear predictor $\eta_{swm}$ depends on three terms:

1. $\beta_0$ is the global average at the reference winter.
We use the last winter in the data as reference.
1. $\beta_w$ is the linear trend along the winters.
1. $b_{m}$ is the relative effect of month $m$. 
This effect models the global seasonal pattern $w$.
It follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with variance $\sigma^2_{m}$.

$$\eta_{swm} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 w + b_m$$

$$b_{m} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_{m})$$

$e^{\beta_w}$ estimates the average yearly change.
$e^{W\beta_w}$ estimates the total linear change over a periode $W$.
We run the analysis both on the last twelve years ($W = 12$) of the time series and on the full length of the time series.

### Average winter maximum

The winter maximum $X_w$ is the largest monthly population total $T_{wm}$ of winter $w$.
We model the winter maxima of the latest ten winters.
We assume that the winter maximum follows a negative binomial distribution with mean $\mu_w$ and overdispersion parameter $n$.

$$X_w = \max(T_{wm})$$

$$X_w \sim NB(\mu_w, n)$$
The mean $\mu_w$ is the link to the linear predictor by 

$$\log(\mu_w) = \eta_w$$

The linear predictor $\eta_w$ depends on two terms:

1. $\beta_0$ is the global average at the reference period.
We use the last five winters in the data as the reference period.
1. $\beta_1$ is the change in average winter maximum between the last two five-winter periods.
$P = 0$ when $w$ is within the last period of five winters.
$P = -1$ when $w$ is within the last but one period of five winters.

$$\eta_w = \beta_0 + \beta_1P$$

$e^{\beta_0}$ estimates the average winter maximum over the last five winters.
It is equivalent to the geometric mean of the winter maxima.
$e^{\beta_1}$ estimates the change in average winter maximum between the last two five-winter periods.

## Interpretation of effects {#s:interpretation}

We compare the 95% credible intervals with a reference, upper and lower threshold to classify the strength of the effect into 10 classes.
The change of a linear trend is converted into a change over the length of the data.
The change of an index is the actual change between the two years.
The reference is set to 0 (no change).
The credible interval of a significant effect does not contain 0.
We selected a change of -25% (3/4 of the initial value) as the lower threshold.
We use the complement^[$\log(3/4) = -0.2877$ and $\log(4/3) = 0.2877$] of that (+33% or 4/3 of the initial value) as the upper threshold.
A -25% or +33% change over 5 years is equivalent to an average yearly change of -5.6% or +5.9% in case of a linear trend.

```{r threshold-yearly}
data.frame(
  duration = c(1, 5, 10, 12, 20, 30)
) %>%
  mutate(
    decrease = log(0.75) / duration,
    increase = -log(0.75) / duration
  ) %>%
  mutate_at(
    c("decrease", "increase"),
    function(x) {
      sprintf("%+.2f%%", 100 * (exp(x) - 1))
    }
  ) %>%
  kable(
    caption = paste(
      "Average yearly change over a period required to yield a total decrease",
      "to 3/4 or total increase to 4/3 of the initial value."
    )
  )
```

Below are the symbols, interpretations and rules for each of the 10 classes.
Fig. \@ref(fig:effect-class) illustrates these rules.

- `++` **strong increase**: A significant positive trend and significantly stronger than the upper threshold.
- `+~` **moderate increase**: A significant positive trend and significantly weaker than the upper threshold.
- `+` **increase**: A significant positive trend, not significantly different from the upper threshold.
- `~` **stable**: A non-significant trend and significantly between the lower and upper threshold.
- `-` **increase**: A significant negative trend, not significantly different from the lower threshold.
- `-~` **moderate decrease**: A significant negative trend and significantly weaker than the lower threshold.
- `--` **strong decrease**: A significant negative trend and significantly stronger than the lower threshold.
- `?+` **potential increase**: A non-significant trend, significantly above the lower threshold.
- `?-` **potential decrease**: A non-significant trend, significantly above the upper threshold.
- `?` **unknown**: A non-significant trend, both the lower and upper threshold are probable.

One of the benefits is that we distinguish `~` (stable) and `?` (unknown). 
Both are not significant.
The main difference between both cases is the uncertainty.
We set the thresholds at important changes.
If the uncertainty is large, then the credible interval contains both the lower and the upper threshold.
So we have no clue what is happening, hence the unknown class.
If the uncertainty is small, then the credible interval contains neither the lower nor the upper threshold.
In this case we do known that the change is less extreme that the thresholds.
So if there is a change, it will be smaller than important changes (the thresholds).
This is informative, even though the change is not significant.

## Overview tables

Part \@ref(p:summarising-tables) contains several tables with effects listing the results for all species with sufficient data.
Chapter \@ref(ch:yearly-change) displays the average yearly change in seasonal population average assuming a linear trend.
Section \@ref(s:yearly-change-12) contains the results using only the last twelve years of the data, while section \@ref(s:yearly-change-tot) uses the full data of the species.
The tables contain the scientific name of the species, the class of the effect (see section \@ref(s:interpretation)) and the estimated change and its 95% credible interval.
The tables are sorted along a decreasing trend.
Species with uncertain trend are listed at the bottom of the tables.
The number is chapter \@ref(ch:total-change) refer to exactly the same trends as in chapter \@ref(ch:yearly-change), expect that the trends are expressed as a total change over the range of the data instead of a an average yearly change.
Please note that when using the full dataset, the time range depends on the species.

Chapter \@ref(ch:wintermaxima) displays results using the winter maxima.
Section \@ref(s:wintermaxima) contains the average winter maximum over the last five year.
These tables contain both a detailed number and a number for publication.
The detailed number is the actual estimate from the model.
The number for publication is a rounded version of the detailed number, with the level of rounding depending on the uncertainty of the detailed number.
We strongly recommend to use the number of publication including the credible interval.
Section \@ref(s:wintermaxima-delta) estimate the relative change in average winter maxima over the last two five-year periods.
This changed is classified along the guidelines in section \@ref(s:interpretation).

## Figures

Each modelled species gets its own chapter with results in part \@ref(p:species).
The results are split into sections per group of sites.
All results are display in a standardized graphical format without comments or interpretation.

### Seasonal average

The results start with a figure showing the estimated seasonal average number of birds.
This is the estimated monthly population, corrected for the overall seasonal pattern.
The line displays the point estimate for each year.
This is the most likely value for the total number of birds in an average month.
The three ribbons display the uncertainty around this point estimate.
They are, from small/dark to wide/light, the 30%, 60% and 90% credible intervals.

### Indices and index raster

An index is a change compared to a baseline.
This baseline is typically the estimate for some reference winter.
E.g we use 2014 as a baseline and compare 2015 with 2013 or 2016 with 2014.
However we cannot use the figure with 2014 as baseline to compare 2015 with 2016.
For that we need a figure with either 2015 or 2016 as baseline.

The last two plots of the section display the index using the first and last available year as the reference.
Plotting all other years would require a large amount of figures.
Therefore we summarise the indices for all possible combinations on a raster.
The x axis holds the winter we want to interpret.
The y axis holds the reference winter.
The dots given the relative change from the baseline (y axis) to the other winter (x axis).
Their colour indicates the strength of the change.
Stronger changes have darker dots, white dots indicate no change.
Red dots indicate a decrease from the baseline, blue dots an increase.
A baseline with all red (blue) dots indicates the winter with the largest (smallest) numbers.
The shape of the dots indicates the classification of the effect (see section \@ref(s:interpretation)).
The equivalent positive and negative classes are collapsed into a single class. 
`++` and `--` become `**`, `+` and `-` become `*`, `+~` and `-~` become `*~` and finally `?+` and `?-` become `?*`.
Informative dots (significant or non-significant but stable) get solid shapes.
Uncertain estimates get an open shape.
