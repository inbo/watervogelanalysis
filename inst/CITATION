First it imports the relevant data from the databank and stores that in an analysis data repository. Then it prepares the analysis objects in the format of the 'n2kanalysis' package. Those objects are sent off to fit, either of a local machine or an AWS EC2 instance. Finaly we generate a technical report on the results.",
