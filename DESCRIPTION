Description: Volunteers count 167 species of the wintering waterbirds in
    Flanders at over 1100 wetland site since the winter of 1991-1992.
    This R package assists the analysis of those records.  First it
    imports the relevant data from the databank and stores that in an
    analysis data repository.  Then it prepares the analysis objects in
    the format of the 'n2kanalysis' package.  Those objects are sent off
    to fit, either of a local machine or an AWS EC2 instance.  Finaly we
    generate a technical report on the results.
